# Count app

A tiny Sinatra and JavaScript web app that shows a number and a button to increment the number.

Deployed at http://count-sheep.herokuapp.com

Exemplifies:

* Making Ajax requests.
* Testing frontend code.
* Separating frontend concerns into model, view and controller.

If you have a reasonably deep understanding of this code, you should be able to pass a JavaScript junior developer tech test.

## User stories

```
As a shepherd
I can see the number of sheep I've counted back into the pen
So I know if the whole flock is home

As a shepherd
I can increment the number of sheep
So I can record the fact that another sheep has gone into the pen

As a shepherd
I can reopen the app and see my latest count
So I don't lose track of my count if my browser crashes
```
